				<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/recent-posts-ultimate/" target="_blank"><strong>Recent Posts Ultimate</strong></a> (Initial launch: Oct. 10th, 2020) - Recent Posts Ultimate takes the best features of five VERY popular recent posts plugins, tosses in the ability to show posts with or without HTML code and gives you a Shortcode builder (which you can copy/paste anywhere on a page, a post or inside a widget), while allowing custom post types to be used.</li>
				<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/liturgical-day-of-the-week/" target="_blank"><strong>Liturgical Day of the Week</strong></a> (Initial launch: Sept. 17th, 2021) - Based on the Catholic Liturgical / Lectionary Calendar, this plugin presents with a colored background associated with that day, plus the day's title, via a combination of the USCCB Liturgical Calendar, and CatholicCulture.org's Liturgical Calendar. One configurable option (time zone offset) and a simple shortcode is all that's needed. Also includes alternative text for organizations within the following Dioceses: Boston, Hartford, New York, Newark, Omaha, Philadelphia</li>

				<div><br />I've been able to benefit, greatly, from the WordPress community, my mentor and other free (and paid) plugins.&ensp;It's allowed me to leverage my knowledge into a full time salaried WordPress developer position.</div>
				<div><br />That said, this plugin, and any others I release are done so with the intent of keeping them 100% <strong><u>free / no cost</u></strong> to you.</div>
				<div><br />I feel like this is the best way I can give back to the community that has benefited me so much.</div>
				<div><br />If this plugin has helped you out, why not chip in a few bucks to buy me a cup of coffee or something?&ensp;I have no plans on making this plugin (or any others) a commercial (paid upgrade) one, so kicking in a few bucks (via the PayPal or CashApp images/links above) helps keep this plugin (and others) movin' forward.&ensp;Thanks!</div>
